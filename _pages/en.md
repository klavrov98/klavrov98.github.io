Hi! I have set up this page to help me hunting for a room in Zurich and to help you to get a sense of who I am.
My Name is Kiril and I'm an incoming PhD Student at the University of Zurich Graduate School of Economics. Previously, I lived in studies in Mannheim for 5 years and have been living in Taipei since 2022.
