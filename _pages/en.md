Hi! I have set up this page for my flat hunt in Zurich to help you to get a sense of who I am. My Name is Kiril (24) and I'm an incoming PhD Student at the [University of Zurich Graduate School of Economics](https://www.econ.uzh.ch/en/study/phd/zurichgse.html). Previously, I lived and studied in Mannheim (DE) for 5 years. As of today, I have been living in Taipei (TW) since 2022. I am looking for a place in Zurich that I can call home starting this summer.

**About Me**: I live a proactive but easy-going lifestyle. I like to hang around in caf√©s in the city, meet friends, going to live-music events and to visit the theatre. During longer breaks, I spend most of my time [budget travelling](https://klavrov98.github.io/travel/). I try to continuously stay open for new people, ideas, and activities. Similarly, my taste in music is quite eclectic and strongly inspired by the people around me; recently, I've mostly been listerning to Indie, Techno, The Beatles, & 70's Turkish psychodelic rock. I spend most of my time outside the flat but I'm down to join a space, where we occasionally cook together, discuss all kinds of obscure topics over a glass of wine, and perhaps care together for a balcony garden. :)

You can find my social media profiles in the left navigation bar or "sneak a peek" at my [couchsurfing.com profile](https://www.couchsurfing.com/people/kiril-lavrov). My email is **kiril.lavrov12[at]gmail.com** (please replace [at] with @). I'm happy to provide a proof of employment & income at UZH upon request.
