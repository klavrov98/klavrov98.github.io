Hi there! I have set up this page for my flat hunt in Zurich to help you to get a sense of who I am. My name is Kiril (25), and I'm a PhD Student at the UZH Graduate School of Economics ([hey, that's me on uzh.ch](https://www.econ.uzh.ch/en/people/graduatestudents/lavrov.html)) since last August. Prior to relocating to Switzerland, I lived in Russia, Germany and Taiwan. I am looking for a place in Zurich that I can call home, ideally for many years to come.

**About Me**: I live a proactive but easy-going lifestyle. In the city, I like to hang around in caf√©s, meet friends, and go to live-music events or the theatre. During longer breaks, I spend most of my time [budget travelling](https://klavrov98.github.io/travel/). I try to continuously stay open to new people, ideas, and activities. Similarly, my taste in music is quite eclectic and strongly inspired by the people around me; recently, I've been listening to Indie, Techno, The Beatles, & 70's Turkish psychedelic rock. I spend most of my time outside the flat but I'm down to join a space, where we occasionally cook, discuss obscure topics over a glass of wine, and perhaps care together for a balcony garden together. I am looking for new hobbies and casual obsessions and am more than happy to get inspired by the people around me. :)

You can find my social media profiles in the left navigation bar or sneak a peek at my [couchsurfing.com profile](https://www.couchsurfing.com/people/kiril-lavrov). My email is **kiril.lavrov12[at]gmail.com** (replace [at] with @). I'm happy to provide proof of employment & income at UZH upon request.
