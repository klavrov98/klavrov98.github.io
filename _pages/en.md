Hi! I have set up this page to help me hunting for a room in Zurich and to help you to get a sense of who I am.
My Name is Kiril and I'm an incoming PhD Student at the University of Zurich Graduate School of Economics. Previously, I lived and studied in Mannheim (DE) for 5 years and have been living in Taipei (TW) since 2022.

**About Me:** I live a proactive, but at the same time relaxed and spontaneous lifestyle. In the city, I like to hang around in caf√©s, meet friends, goint to live-music events and the theatre. My taste in music is quite eclectic and strongly inspired by the people around me. Most of my free time, I spend budget travelling.
When going out, I prefer to go to bars where it's easy to chat with people or dance to techno.
