Hi! I have set up this page to help me hunting for a room in Zurich and to help you to get a sense of who I am.
My Name is Kiril and I'm an incoming PhD Student at the [University of Zurich Graduate School of Economics](https://www.econ.uzh.ch/en/study/phd/zurichgse.html). Previously, I lived and studied in Mannheim (DE) for 5 years. As of today, I have been living in Taipei (TW) since 2022. I am looking for a place in Zurich that I can call home, ideally for the next few years, starting this summer.

**About Me**: I live a proactive, but at the same time relaxed and spontaneous lifestyle. In the city, I like to hang around in caf√©s, meet friends, goint to live-music events and visiting the theatre. My taste in music is quite eclectic and strongly inspired by the people around me. During my breaks, I spend most of my time [budget travelling](https://klavrov98.github.io/travel/). When going out, I prefer to go to bars where it's easy to chat with people or dance to techno. I love to try out new hobbies. I like to cook and trying out new recipes. While I tend to be on the run a lot, I am looking for a shared flat, where we can enjoy occasional evenings together. I am more than happy to join or kickstart a small home project, such as decorating our common space or caring for a balcony garden.
